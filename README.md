# hello-world
My name is QiaoJing Qiu. This is the first module task I did in my ITM 352 class.


I am a junior in Shidler college of business, majored in accounting. Even though I never has an experience in coding, I am interested in it. I believe coding is a useful skill for college students. Thus, I take ITM 352 to learn about it.
